# Basic concept

## problem definition

The rise of the social media has brought us a split in society. On the one hand people embrace the opportunity to stay in touch with people all over the world. Communicating has never been easier. On the other hand people hate to see everyone messing about with their phone instead of communicating with the one who is right in front of them. In the train, the bus of even the dinner table.

I can't choose a side! Both arguments really make sense to me.

I strongly feel there is a need for an app here. An app to bring both sided together. Letting people communicate with their loved ones by using their phone, without losing sight of the people right next to them.

## suggested solution

Imagine sitting in a train compartment with 9 others. You and 8 of them are using the mobile phone. One guy is just feeling lonely. He does have a phone, but none of his friends are online. Or he is just not interested in his phone, which is in his pocket. His name is Ben.
Suddely the guy next to him turns his head and says: "Hi Ben, good morning." Ben smiles.

So what happend there?

Everyone in the train, or at least 80% of them installed the lonely world app on their phone. The app keeps track of location and phone activity. When the phone is in the facinity of a 'crowd', with a really strong active to non-active phone user ratio, it pulls up a notification: lonely non-active user in the facinity! When privicy settings permit it, it even gives the name of that non-active user, so everyone who is too busy texting or swiping can greet him and make his day.
